# EEG-Experiments

This repository hosts a curated collection of EEG-based experiments designed to explore brain-computer interface concepts and cognitive processes. It features:

- Input-Based Experiments: Engage users with mouse, keyboard, or touch-based interactions.
- Non-Input-Based Experiments: Focus on passive EEG signal analysis without user input.
- Inspired by PsyToolkit: Many experiments are derived or adapted from the popular PsyToolkit framework.
- Developed in Python: Built entirely in Python, leveraging its rich ecosystem for scientific computing and experimental design.

This repository serves as a resource for researchers, developers, and enthusiasts exploring the intersection of EEG technology, neuroscience, and behavioral experiments
